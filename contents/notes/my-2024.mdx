At the beginning of 2024, I had the following goals in mind:

- Become an freelance engineer
- Purchase a traditional Japanese house in the countryside
- Workcation abroad

Here’s how they turned out:

## Becoming an Freelance Engineer

Since joining mofmof inc in July 2022, I have been fortunate to work as an engineer and gain invaluable experience.
In October 2024, I made the decision to take the next step and start freelancing.

I am deeply grateful for the opportunities and support I received at mofmof, which have been instrumental in my growth.
Moving forward, I hope to continue creating value through technology that makes a difference for others.

## Purchasing a Japanese Traditional House

I’ve been searching for the perfect traditional Japanese house since around 2018, and at the beginning of 2024, I finally found an ideal property and made an immediate decision to purchase it.
The house requires extensive renovations, so I haven’t moved in yet, but I’m planning to relocate by early 2025.
It’s located in the countryside of Japan, surrounded by beautiful nature.
I have many things I want to do with this house, and I’m excited to enjoy the journey step by step.

## Workcation Abroad

Unfortunately, this didn’t happen.
I had planned to spend about a month in Southeast Asia, but I was too busy to preparing for the new house.
I’m hoping to give it another try next year. In addition to Southeast Asia, I’m also considering Australia as a potential destination for future workcations.
